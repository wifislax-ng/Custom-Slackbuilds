# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hwloc: hwloc (Portable Hardware Locality)
hwloc:
hwloc: The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a
hwloc: portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the
hwloc: hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
hwloc: nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading.
hwloc: It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory
hwloc: information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network
hwloc: interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily aims at helping
hwloc: applications with gathering information about modern computing
hwloc: hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.
