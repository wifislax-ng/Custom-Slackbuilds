John the Ripper is a fast password cracker.  Its primary purpose is to detect 
weak passwords.  Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly 
found on various Unix flavors, supported out of the box are Kerberos AFS and 
Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hashes, plus several more with contributed patches.
